# Part 1: Introduction and Context of the Data
The following dataset contains economic information from jurisdictions in the nation of China. 
For each province and years from 1949 to 2017, numeric values are listed: **_Enterprises_** and **_Outputs_**. Enterprises represent productive units or companies and are absolute values.
Outputs are in units in of 100,000,000 RMB (Chinese Yuan). As for patterns of the data, Enterprises don't only have drastic decreases when companies go out of business. Companies can be bought out or merged with others, as evident with rising Output values over the years.

#### **Information on Provinces, Municipalities, Autonomous Regions, and Special Administrative Regions:**
Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing and Tianjin are classified as municipalities and not provinces or cities. Municipalities fall directly within the administration of the central government, but have the same jurisdictional, political, and economic rights as a province. Guangxi, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, Tibet, and Xinjiang are classified as Autonomous Regions. These areas have more legislative rights than provinces and have a higher population of minority ethnic groups.

Of the 4 municipalities, 5 Autonomous Regions, and 22 provinces of China included in the data, some may argue about the exclusion of three locations: Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau. These areas are falsely believed to be under the jurisdiction of the People's Republic of China. Taiwan considers itself as an independent country, but "Mainland China" disagrees with this. This was the result of the Civil War between the two countries in the 1940's.
Hong Kong and Macau are classified as SARs, a.k.a. Special Administrative Regions. Similar to Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau can be considered separate entities from mainland China, though they are near the territorial boundary (China Today). This is why most Chinese statistics exclude these three areas. To find statistics for Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau, one may have to stray away from sources under the People's Republic of China. [City University of Hong Kong's](https://libguides.library.cityu.edu.hk/stats/hk) library website has various resources for statistics on these three areas.

#### **Issues with Chinese Statistics:** 
In this economic dataset, many values are denoted with "NA", which most likely means the data is missing. 
However, it has been proven that there are broader issues with Chinese economic statistics. Issues with Chinese statistics may include censorship or intentional omittance of data. China has a history of censorship and Communism, which may partly explain this. Essentially, Chinese statistics in general have been revealed to be falsified and/or intentionally inflated to "meet economic growth quotas" (China Quarterly). An article from Cambridge explains the bias shown from certain sampling techniques used by the Chinese.
A CIA report published in 2007 explores in detail as to why Chinese statistics are problematic. They state that

> "During the past 22 years the Chinese statistical system has had its ups and downs, but even during the better years, in most fields it was not capable of collecting and processing statistics that would meet even the minimal standards for accuracy." (CIA)

So, several factors contribute to the problems arising from Chinese statistics. One reform that the NBS (National Bureau of Statistics of China) enacted was to maintain close relations with the largest enterprises in industry, commerce, and construction for increased credibility.
